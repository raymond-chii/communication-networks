# ECE 303: Communication Networks

This repository contains projects related to ECE 303: Communication Networks.


## Project 1: Simple Webserver

The first project involves creating a TCP socket in Python. This socket will be used to handle HTTP packets. The web server should be able to handle one HTTP request at a time. Here's a high-level overview of the tasks involved:

- Socket Creation: Create a socket and bind it to a specific port and address.
- HTTP Request Handling: Accept and parse the incoming HTTP request.
- File Retrieval: Retrieve the requested file from the server's file system.
- Response Generation: Create an HTTP response message. This message should consist of the requested file preceded by header lines.
- Response Sending: Send the response directly to the client.
- Error Handling: If the requested file is not found on the server, send an HTTP "404 Not Found" message back to the client.
